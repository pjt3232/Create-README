## Description
My motivation for this project was to better my skills as a full stack web developer, so that it can help me pursue a career in this field. I built this application to better my skills in the backend of the server, which I was recently introduced to. This app solves the problem of wanting to create a README.md file for your repo in an easier way that uses less typing and builds the file simply based on your content you would like to include in the README.md file. I learned skills from this project such as how to create an application using the backend side of the server, how to use NPM packages to create a more in-depth app with less user created code, and how to use node.js to allow your computer to be compatible with backend applications.

## Installation
To install this application, you need to have a Node.js, which is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, installed to your computer. I recommend using Node.js v18.16.0, which I used, but is compatible with most recent versions of Node.js. The instructions to install Node.js are at this website [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Once Node.js is installed, you need to download Inquirer. Inquirer is an NPM (Node Package Manager) and is necessary for this application. To install this NPM, type in the this line of code, "npm install inquirer@8.2.4". Add this line of code in the desired directory that you wish to use this app. These two installations are necessary for the application to run.

## Usage
To use this application as intended, navigate to the directory within the "Develop" folder and run this line of code, "node index.js". This will run the application and ask a series of questions asking about what content you would like to include in the README.md file being created. After you answer the questions, the file will be created and you can copy and paste this README into your desired repo or use it for any other purpose. Below is a video of the application being run in real time and is a visual for how to use this app and how it looks when successfully ran.

## Credits
I used a starter code for this project. The starter code is the second commit on my repo and it makes up the skeleton of the JavaScript files used fot the application. It includes the export module code, the names of the functions and where to put the JavaScript that I added, and provided tha basis of the comments in each JS file. The creators of the starter code and the location of the starter code on GitHub can be found below:
